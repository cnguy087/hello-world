# hello-world

Hello all!

Currently I'm in my last quarter of undergraduate studies. Some days I feel like I'm ready for grad school, other days I don't know if I can handle it. I think some days I'm really quick with thinking but a lot of them I tend to be slow. I don't know why I seem to have two types of personalities.
